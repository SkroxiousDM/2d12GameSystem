#chapter("Generic Focuses", [Twenty-four setting-neutral Focuses complete the sentence: "...who [Focus]." Each one has two power tags, a weakness, a link to another player character, and tiered abilities with a choice at Tiers 2 and 3.], epigraph: [The verb of the character sentence.])

=== 1.1 What a Focus Gives You
#figure(
  [#table(
    columns: (25%, 75%),
    align: (auto,auto,),
    table.header([Element], [Detail],),
    table.hline(),
    [#strong[Power tags];], [2],
    [#strong[Weakness tag];], [1 (can be compelled for Tychē Points)],
    [#strong[PC link];], [A prompt that connects you to another player character],
    [#strong[Tier 1 ability];], [Fixed; gained at creation for free],
    [#strong[Tier 2 ability];], [#strong[Choose 1 of 2];; after 3 Advances, costs an Advance],
    [#strong[Tier 3 ability];], [#strong[Choose 1 of 2];; after 6 Advances, costs an Advance],

- #strong[The other option:] once you\'ve reached a tier, you may take its unchosen option later as a normal Advance.
- #strong[★ Major:] costs 1 Refresh when taken (Core Rules §4.1). Every Focus has exactly one ★ option, always at Tier 3, so you can always choose a path that keeps your Refresh.
- #strong[Any playbook can take any Focus.] The \"Suits\" line is a suggestion.
#colbreak()
- #strong[Changing Focus:] at a major milestone, with GM approval, you can swap your Focus. You keep Tier 1 of the new one and rebuy higher tiers with Advances.

=== 1.2 Weird Focuses ◈
Focuses marked #strong[◈ Weird] assume the supernatural, impossible technology, or both. In mundane settings the GM removes them from the list. Every other Focus works in any genre.

=== 1.3 Shared Rules Reminders
- Free bonus dice from Focuses still count toward the #strong[+2 bonus die maximum];.
- Abilities that add bonus above the tag cap only do so for the tag they name, and are limited to #strong[+1 above the normal +2 cap (maximum +3)] unless stated otherwise.
- Only #strong[one cost reduction] applies to a single Effect (e.g. you can\'t combine two \"costs 1 Power instead of 2\" abilities).
